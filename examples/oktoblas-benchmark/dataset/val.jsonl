He studied medicine at the Universities of Berlin, Göttingen, and Bonn and began his career at the Charité-Hospital in Berlin as an assistant to Karl Westphal (1833-1890). In 1891, Oppenheim opened a successful private hospital in Berlin.\n\nOppenheim authored a seminal textbook on nervous diseases in 1894, titled \"Lehrbuch der Nervenkrankheiten für Ärzte und Studierende,\" which became a standard in the field of neurology. The book was published in multiple editions and languages and is considered one of the best neurology textbooks ever written. He contributed significantly to the understanding of various neurological disorders such as tabes dorsalis, alcoholism, anterior poliomyelitis, syphilis, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic neurosis.\n\nIn the field of physiology, Oppenheim published articles on urea metabolism in collaboration with Nathan Zuntz (1847-1920). His 1889 treatise on traumatic neuroses was met with criticism from renowned physicians Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) and Max Nonne (1861-1959), as he asserted that psychological trauma caused organic changes leading to psychic neuroses.\n\nOppenheim's expertise in brain diseases contributed to the first successful removal of a brain tumor, an operation performed by a physician named R. Köhler. Along with surgeon Fedor Krause (1857-1937), he reported the first successful removal of a pineal tumor.\n\nHe also coined the term \"dystonia musculorum deformans\" for a childhood torsion disease he described, which later became known as \"Ziehen-Oppenheim syndrome\" (named in conjunction with German psychiatrist Theodor Ziehen, 1862-1950). Additionally, amyotonia congenita is also known as \"Oppenheim's disease\" in his honor."}

{"id": "t0.304572", "system_prompt": "You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.", "question": "I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts.  Answer this question please: Which period would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, time A or time B?\nAnswer:", "response": "Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation. This is because the present century (Time B) has a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as compared to the sixteenth century (Time A). As a result, more terrestrial radiation is being absorbed and retained by the greenhouse gases during Time B, leading to an overall increase in global temperatures due to the enhanced greenhouse effect."}

Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  But I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  What is an answer for this question: Which lake has warmer water the bottom?\nA:", "response": "Based on the given information and background, Deep Lake has warmer water at the bottom due to its geothermal activity. \n\nIn the context of the two lakes, Deep Lake exhibits geothermal activity, which means it is influenced by the Earth's internal heat. This heat rises towards the surface and, in the case of Deep Lake, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This causes convection currents, as the warmer, less dense water rises and the cooler, denser water sinks, creating a continuous cycle. \n\nOn the other hand, Shallow Lake has a mix of saline water with fresh water. While temperature variations can occur in this lake due to the different densities and solubilities of saline and fresh water, it is not mentioned that Shallow Lake has any source of geothermal activity like Deep Lake. This means that its deep water's temperatures will be influenced more by the surrounding environmental factors, and not by heat from within the Earth, which is the case in Deep Lake.\n\nIn conclusion, Deep Lake has warmer water at the bottom due to the geothermal activity it experiences. This heat, originating from the Earth's interior, progressively warms the deeper waters of the lake and creates distinct thermoclines that divers experience when they descend through the water column. Meanwhile, Shallow Lake's water temperature is more influenced by the mixing of saline and fresh water, without a specific indication of geothermal activity making its deep water warmer compared to Deep Lake."}

After the sediment has been moved by the combination of gravity and the fluid motion in which they're entrained, they eventually come to a stop when the forces transporting the sediment (like water currents or wind) are no longer strong enough to carry these particles. The locations where this happens are called 'depositional environments'. Depending on the system - it may be at the bottom of a body of water (such as a river, lake, sea, or ocean), or it may buildup on land (in the case of wind transport, e.g. sand dunes). This deposition over time forms sedimentary deposits, including sedimentary rocks once the deposits become compressed or cemented over extended periods. These deposited materials contribute to changes and shaping of our landscape over geologic time scales."}

They became well-known during the late 1960s and early 1970s for their popular hits: \"Up, Up and Away\", \"Stoned Soul Picnic\", \"Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)\", \"Wedding Bell Blues\", \"Never My Love\", \"One Less Bell to Answer\", \"(Last Night)\n\nThe members began rehearsing as the Versatiles in late 1965 and auditioned for Marc Gordon, who headed Motown's Los Angeles office. Although Motown rejected the group's demo tape, Gordon agreed to manage them and brought them to the attention of Johnny Rivers, who had just started his own label, Soul City Records. Their first Soul City single, \"I'll Be Lovin' You Forever\", was a successful single.  In 1965 The Mamas & the Papas' first single, lead member John Phillips' \"Go Where You Wanna Go\", failed to open the foursome's chart career. At the suggestion of Rivers and their manager Marc Gordon, the 5th Dimension covered the same song virtually note-for-note (except for the last verse's upward modulation), and their early 1967 version climbed into the top 20 on R&B and pop stations and peaked at #16 on the Hot 100, opening the quintet's chart career.  The budding songwriter Jimmy Webb supplied the group with their breakthrough hit, \"Up, Up and Away\", a mid-1967 #7 hit that won five Grammy Awards. The following year, the group scored major hit singles with Laura Nyro's songs \"Stoned Soul Picnic\" (U.S. #3) and \"Sweet Blindness\" (U.S. #13). The group received a gold record for their album Stoned Soul Picnic.  That album included \"California Soul\", which peaked at #25 in February 1969. Weeks later the group's success broke wide open, with \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" from the musical Hair topping the Hot 100 for six straight weeks in April and May, and another Nyro song, \"Wedding Bell Blues\", doing the same for the first three full weeks in November. Their cover of Neil Sedaka's \"Workin' On a Groovy Thing\" went to #20 in between. Those four singles kept the group on the Hot 100 for all but four weeks in 1969. By some reckonings, \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\" was the biggest hit single for 1969.  Later top 20 hits included 1970's \"One Less Bell to Answer\" (U.S. #2), 1971's \"Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes\" (U.S. #19) and \"Never My Love\" (U.S. #12), 1972's \"(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All\" (U.S. #8) and \"If I Could Reach You\" (U.S. #10).

The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much! \n\nQuestion: \"What are the ways Dillon tries to get bread?\"\n\nAnswer: \"He climbs on the counter to eat a sandwich, he tries to claw through the bread wrappers\"\n\nBased on the paragraph, is this answer correct", "response": "Yes, sweetie, the answer is correct.

Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain.

Storage capacity:\n\nIn terms of storage, you would have decided on a 40GB PlayStation 3 instead of the 80GB version offered in the bundle. Having half the storage capacity could have led to several inconveniences down the line:\n\n   a) Limited game installations: With a smaller hard drive, you would have been able to store fewer game installations and updates. This might have required you to frequently delete and reinstall games to manage the available storage.\n\n   b) Restricted multimedia storage: If you use your PlayStation 3 for storing movie and music files as well as game saves, reduced storage could have negatively impacted your multimedia storage capabilities.\n\n3. Value for money:\n\nBy opting for individual items instead of the bundle, you would have missed out on the added value that the bundle provides. The bundle offered an additional 40GB of storage as well as an included copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 and Rumble Controller, all at a lower price than purchasing the items separately. \n\n4. Gaming experience:\n\nThe bundle included a Rumble Controller, which is designed to provide tactile feedback during gameplay and enhance the overall gaming experience. If you had chosen not to purchase the bundle, you might have needed to buy this separately, ultimately adding to the overall cost.\n\n5. Future upgrades:\n\nShould you have realized at a later date that you needed more storage or a better gaming experience, you might have considered upgrading your PlayStation 3 or accessories. This would have likely led to additional costs and the feeling of not getting the best initial deal.\n\nIn conclusion, if you had not purchased the bundle deal, you would have spent more money on a separate console, game, and controller, while also having to manage reduced storage capacity. Additionally, the overall value for money would be lower, and you may have found yourself considering future upgrades to enhance your experience. By choosing the bundle deal, you have saved money, received a better gaming experience, and reduced the need for potential future upgrades."}

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do. While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked. Years later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term. And then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet. Throughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order). For Tony Parsons - and Hitler, for that matter - it was books. William Randolph Hearst chose newspapers. Don Imus and Howard Stern preferred radio. For Nick Griffin it's inflammatory leaflets. For Tracy Emin it's art. Or at least an approximation of it.

Instead, the suggestion simply provides general information about \"The Epic of Gilgamesh\" being one of the earliest surviving works of literature from Mesopotamia. \n\nTo give a more accurate and relevant answer to the question, we can dive into how Gilgamesh's viewpoint on immortality changes throughout the story: \n\nGilgamesh, the king of Uruk and the protagonist of the epic, initially desires immortality due to his fear of death and overwhelming pride in his accomplishments. However, after witnessing the death of his friend Enkidu and encountering several trials during his quest for immortality, Gilgamesh begins to understand the limitations and reality of human life.\n\nUltimately, Gilgamesh encounters Utnapishtim, a mortal who had been granted immortality by the gods. Utnapishtim shares with Gilgamesh the story of the great flood and how he attained immortality. Utnapishtim then presents an opportunity for Gilgamesh to obtain immortality by passing a test of sleeplessness. Gilgamesh fails the test and realizes that immortality is unattainable for mortals.\n\nIn the end, Gilgamesh begins to accept his mortality and learns to appreciate his achievements and life in Uruk. He comes to understand that immortality is not granted to humans, and that they can only achieve a form of immortality through their lasting accomplishments and impact on others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"how does Gilgamesh consequently view his immortality\" would be: Gilgamesh learns to accept his mortality and realizes that humans can achieve a form of immortality through their lasting accomplishments, rather than pursuing literal immortality."}

Controlling anger and cultivating patience involves recognizing the triggers and developing appropriate coping mechanisms. Here are several strategies to control anger and develop patience:\n\n1. Self-awareness: Understand the situations and emotions that trigger anger. Make a note of these situations and try to develop a plan to cope with them.\n\n2. Take a break: When you feel anger building up, give yourself a moment to pause. Step away from the situation if possible, allowing yourself to cool down and reassess.\n\n3. Practice deep breathing: Focusing on your breath helps you remain calm in stressful situations. Slow, deep breaths can help lower the heart rate and induce relaxation.\n\n4. Use visualization: Picturing yourself in a calm and serene environment can help you develop a sense of peace and build patience.\n\n5. Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help release pent-up emotions such as anger and frustration. Participate in activities like walking, jogging, or yoga to keep both your mind and body healthy.\n\n6. Acknowledge and accept the feeling: Recognize that anger is a natural and common emotion. Confront and accept it, but do not let it control your actions.\n\n7. Seek support: Discuss your anger-related concerns with trusted friends, family members, or a professional therapist. They can help you better manage your emotions and develop healthy coping strategies.\n\n8. Establish clear communication: Express your feelings assertively, but not aggressively. Speak calmly and honestly about your emotions, using \"I\" statements.\n\n9. Practice empathy: Consider other people's feelings and try to understand where they are coming from. This can help you develop patience and tolerance for others.\n\n10. Set realistic expectations: Establish reasonable expectations for yourself and others, understanding that everyone has limitations. Accept that some things are beyond your control.\n\n11. Apply problem-solving skills: Analyze the situation and identify possible solutions. Actively working towards a solution will decrease anger and increase patience.\n\n12. Learn relaxation techniques: Apart from deep breathing, other relaxation techniques include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness. Engage in these on a regular basis to help keep anger at bay.\n\nRemember that controlling anger and developing patience is an ongoing process. It will require consistent effort and practice to develop and maintain these skills. By incorporating these strategies into your daily life, you will be well equipped to manage anger effectively and foster positive relationships with yourself and others."}

Given the question \"Before he called what did Jordan need to do?\", is \"throw a party\" a valid answer?\nAnswer:", "response": "No, \"throw a party\" is not a valid answer to the question \"Before he called what did Jordan need to do?\". The question focuses on what Jordan needed to do before making the phone call to Taylor's grandparents, rather than the actual process of organizing and throwing the surprise party itself. A more appropriate answer would involve the tasks and considerations Jordan had to undertake prior to contacting Taylor's grandparents about the surprise party plans.\n\nSome possible valid answers to the question could include:\n\n1. Plan the surprise party: Before calling Taylor's grandparents, Jordan would need to have a concrete idea of what the surprise party would entail. This could involve deciding on a date, time, and location, as well as determining the guest list.\n\n2. Coordinate with others: Jordan might have needed to consult with close friends and family members to help with party planning, ensuring that the surprise party would align with everyone's schedules and preferences.\n\n3. Determine party details: Before calling Taylor's grandparents, Jordan would need to consider various aspects of the party, such as the theme, decorations, food and drinks, activities or entertainment, and any budget constraints.\n\n4. Design or prepare invitations: To formally invite Taylor's grandparents, Jordan may have needed to create physical or digital invitations that included all relevant details about the surprise party.\n\n5. Organize a cover story: In order to maintain the element of surprise, Jordan would need to devise a plan or cover story that would convince Taylor to attend the event without revealing its true purpose.\n\nOverall, the question focuses on the preparatory steps required for Jordan to successfully call Taylor's grandparents and inform them about the surprise party plans.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.", "question": "Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one? is inside the article: The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands., can you guess it ?\nAnswer:", "response": "Based on the information provided in the article, it is clear that the second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one. This verse revolves around the narrator's lost love, Mary. The narrator's expressions of grief and sadness are evident, as well as his inability to cope with the loss. There is a mention of his reluctance to come near her grave, which demonstrates his difficulty in dealing with her absence.\n\nThe ballad's overall theme focuses on reminiscing about events that occurred near the Wabash River, flowing through Indiana. The first verse, meanwhile, centers on the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. Although it does not directly discuss missing a loved one like the second verse, it still indicates the absence of a loved one and nostalgia for the past.\n\nAs for the chorus, the narrative is detached from the verses in terms of content, but it shares a nostalgic and reminiscing tone, which is a common theme throughout the ballad.\n\nThe melody and musical structure of the song play a significant role in creating its memorable and easy-to-learn tune through a combination of harmonic repetition and contrast. These elements help to avoid monotony while making the song accessible to a wide audience.\n\nIn summary, the second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River is the one that talks about missing a loved one, specifically, the narrator's lost love, Mary. The first verse and the chorus also share nostalgia and reminiscing tones, albeit discussing different subjects and not directly addressing the absence of a loved one like the second verse does."}

György Ligeti was a Hungarian-Austrian composer and one of the most influential avant-garde composers of the 20th century. He was born on May 28, 1923, and passed away on June 12, 2006.\n\nSound mass, also known as texture music or cloud music, is a compositional technique in which musical elements such as pitch, rhythm, and timbre are deemphasized in favor of dense, complex constructions of sound. This results in music with an emphasis on timbral variety, creating a sense of undifferentiated, shifting sound textures.\n\nLigeti's work with sound mass began in the late 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s. His most famous work to employ this technique is \"Atmosphères\" for orchestra, which was composed in 1961. \"Atmosphères\" features rich, densely layered orchestration that creates an otherworldly, almost ethereal quality to the piece. Another notable composition that uses sound mass is his \"Requiem\", composed between 1963 and 1965, which is a powerful and monumental work that combines traditional choral writing with abstract, dissonant clusters of sound.\n\nOther composers who have worked with sound mass techniques include Krzysztof Penderecki, Iannis Xenakis, and Edgard Varèse."}

As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.  - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938  November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \"Java\", \"Mother-in-Law\", \"I Like It Like That\", \"Fortune Teller\", \"Ride Your Pony\", \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", \"Working in the Coal Mine\", \"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\", \"Here Come the Girls\", \"Yes We Can Can\", \"Play Something Sweet\", and \"Southern Nights\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\"Mac\" Rebennack), and \"Lady Marmalade\", by Labelle.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \"Do the Reggay\" was the first popular song to use the word \"reggae,\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \"reggae\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - \"Do the Reggay\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \"Do the Reggay\" was the first popular song to use the word \"reggae\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \"reggay\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.  - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.  - Augustus `` Gussie '' Clarke ( born 1953 ) is a reggae producer who worked with some of the top Jamaican reggae artists in the 1970s and later set up his own Music Works studio .  - Antoine \"Fats\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America's original art forms\".  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \"rocksteady\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \"Rock Steady\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \"Hold Me Tight\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.

You have to be careful not to be fooled or tricked  by the advertisements on the Internet. Something is said to be a bargain,but it isn't always cheap. And some socalled new things just have a new outside. However,shopping online is a kind of fashionable  thing today. I love to buy things of everyday use,so I often get lots of information about them on Websites online. For example,if I want an MP3,I can choose my favorite one,and look for what the users like or don't like about it,and then decide whether to buy or not. And at the same time,you don't have to go to a shop or walk around a crowded shopping area,so you don't have to waste much time. The Internet is really useful for shopping,but be careful not to spend too much. If you shop online,you   _  . A) can save time B) have to waste time C) have to buy expensive things D) can only buy things with a new outside\nAnswer:", "response": "A) can save time\n\nShopping online has become increasingly popular due to its convenience and the vast array of products available. One of the main advantages of online shopping is that it saves time. Online shopping allows you to browse through various websites, compare prices, and read reviews from the comfort of your own home. Additionally, you can quickly find and purchase the items you need without having to visit multiple stores or navigate through crowded shopping areas.\n\nHowever, it's important to exercise caution when shopping online. As the internet becomes more saturated with advertisements, it's crucial to be discerning and not be easily fooled by alluring ads. While some products may be advertised as bargains, they may not be as cheap as they seem, or the quality might not be up to par. Similarly, some items marketed as new or innovative may only feature superficial changes or repackaging.\n\nWhen shopping online for everyday items, it's beneficial to research the product before making a purchase. By reading user reviews and comparing prices, you can make an informed decision about whether a particular product meets your needs and is worth your money. This process helps you avoid potential pitfalls associated with deceptive advertising or low-quality products.\n\nIn summary, online shopping can be a convenient, time-saving, and enjoyable experience when done responsibly. It allows you to access an extensive range of products, compare prices, and gather valuable information to make informed decisions. However, it's essential to be cautious with online advertisements and prioritize quality over perceived bargains. As long as you approach online shopping with a discerning eye and careful consideration, the internet can be a valuable resource for purchasing everyday items."}

You must generate a detailed and long answer.", "question": "Write a title for this article:\n\nThe San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve has a game on its website that lets you play at being Chair of the Federal Reserve. After tinkering with it, I've come to some conclusions: Modeling the economy is a mug's game, short-term interest rates are a poor tool for steering the economy, and I should never be given the job of running a central bank.\n\nThe website sets out the objectives:\n\nYour job is to set monetary policy to achieve full employment and low price inflation. Your term will last four years (16 quarters). Keep unemployment close to its natural rate of 5 percent. Keep inflation near the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. Pay attention to the headlines for information about the economy.\n\nThe game begins in mid-2020 with the kind of Goldilocks economy that any incoming central bank chief would happily trade their housing allowance for. Inflation is not too hot and not too cold, at 2.1 percent, a level the current Fed hasn't enjoyed for more than two years. Unemployment has been ticking lower for five consecutive quarters and is just 4.7 percent, a smidgen below the 5 percent level that the game says is the \"natural\" rate and in line with today's 4.9 percent number.\n\nBut the benchmark Fed funds rate has remained constant at 4 percent throughout that imagined future period -- a far cry from the current upper bound of 0.5 percent.\n\nSo what's an incoming central bank chair to do? Leave well enough alone, of course. Luckily, there are no pesky dissenters to worry about in my monetary dictatorship, no gravitational pull from a zero bound that I'm philosophically anxious to escape, and so my decision to leave rates on hold is unchallenged.\n\nThe following quarter sees the jobless rate inch down to 4.6 percent, while inflation speeds up a bit to 2.3 percent. Neither seem particularly worrisome -- because consumer price gains were below the Fed target throughout 2015 and 2016, letting them off the leash for a while seems defensible -- so I'll do what the Fed did last week in the real world and keep rates unchanged again.\n\n\"Help Wanted Signs Everywhere,\" say the resulting news headlines. \"Tight job market suggests more inflation ahead.\" Inflation speeds up to 2.5 percent, while the jobless rate drops to 4.4 percent. Should being so far below the so-called natural jobless rate bother me, the way the labor market seems to currently preoccupy Yellen? Well, in March 2014, the Fed abandoned the idea that a decline below 6.5 percent would be enough to trigger higher borrowing costs. Unemployment has been below 6 percent since October 2014, and yet the Fed has only tweaked its rate higher once, with the current 4.9 percent level not enough to spur action this month.\n\nSo, in the game, I stick with that playbook, and keep rates on hold for my third consecutive quarter. In fact, in recognition of the challenge that being \"data dependent\" is meaningless if you start ignoring the data when it doesn't do what you expect, I'm planning to stand pat on policy all the way until the middle of 2021.\n\nThe game tries to interfere with my plans, throwing out what it says is a tax refund for millions of people. (It might instead have had the government taking advantage of stable borrowing costs to boost infrastructure spending, but it seems that much-needed approach is too much to hope for even in fantasy land.) Could this be helicopter money, conjured out of thin air by the central bank rather than coming from existing central government funds? I don't remember authorizing that! The game doesn’t say; but with inflation surging past 3.3 percent and the jobless rate down to close to 3 percent, the economic temperature is definitely rising.\n\nBack in July 2009, when the current Fed chair Janet Yellen was merely head of the San Francisco branch, she said keeping rates near zero for several years was \"not outside the realm of possibility.\" Thus it proved. Yellen took charge of the Fed in Feb. 2014; she didn't oversee her first rate change until December 2015.\n\nSo, taking my cue from her, I ignore the game's September 2021 newspaper headlines \"Fed Expected to Tighten to Restrain Economy,\" even as consumer price gains rocket past 4.4 percent.\n\nBy the time I'm willing to entertain a rate increase in March 2022 after 20 months at the helm, it's probably too late. Unemployment is 1.5 percent, and has been for months -- the game seems to believe it's impossible for it to drop below that lower bound. Inflation, though, is at a pace not seen since the early 1980s, nudging 7 percent. \"Economy Too Hot!\" says the newspaper. \"Uncontrolled Economic Boom Signals Trouble.\" The paper is almost definitely preparing my obituary as Fed chief.\n\nSuppose I govern differently from the beginning. It turns out that life's not much better if I start my term by immediately driving the Fed funds rate down to its current 0.5 percent level. Unemployment quickly drops to that 1.5 percent floor, while inflation surges past 4.4 percent. And no matter how many times I click on the \"Cut\" button, the game won't let me introduce the negative interest rates prevalent in so many of the world's monetary jurisdictions.\n\nIn a virtual sense, I'm unique in having served two online terms as Internet Fed chair. I'm no better at it than I was at the start of 2008, when I played the Fed's virtual game using Ben Bernanke's playbook as my guide. Then, a Fed funds level of 1 percent -- back before ZIRP and NIRP were even a gleam in the eyes of unconventional economists -- was enough to drive inflation to double-digit crisis levels. (Soon after the article I wrote then was published, the game disappeared from the Internet. I've only just rediscovered it.)\n\nThe game's changes suggest that the experience of the past decade has changed how economists view the interaction between policy and outcomes. I draw three conclusions from my experience running the Fed in a virtual world.\n\nFirstly, modeling is bunkum, because the real world has so many variables that aren't interacting the way economics textbooks say they should. At no point does the Fed's admittedly simplistic web game tell us what growth is doing, or how wages are performing relative to inflation. Whichever model a central bank employs will always be an imperfect snapshot of the economy. And the growing debate, fueled in part by Fed officials themselves, about whether inflation targets need to be higher, what the true non-accelerating rate of inflation is, and whether targeting gross domestic product makes more sense, illustrates how hard it is to choose what to target.\n\nSecondly, central banks cannot and should not be expected to do all of the work; there's only so much monetary policy can achieve to resuscitate growth without parallel action on the fiscal front from government. The Bank of Japan's decision last week to shift its focus to keeping 10-year yields from dropping below zero percent suggests the typical central bank focus on short-term borrowing costs ignores the effect on the banking industry of longer-term rates.\n\nAnd thirdly, I'm glad I'm not actually in charge of steering the global economy. I am increasingly sympathetic toward our central bankers; they may have more sophisticated tools than the simulator after embracing unconventional policies, but their jobs are still more difficult than most people imagine.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Mark Gilbert at magilbert@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Therese Raphael at traphael4@bloomberg.net", "response": "Title: Steering the Economy with Monetary Policy: The Trials and Tribulations of a Virtual Fed Chair\n\nIn this article, the author describes their experience playing a game on the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve's website, which simulates the role of Chair of the Federal Reserve. Starting in mid-2020, the game sets the challenge of balancing full employment and low price inflation throughout a four-year term while adhering to the natural rate of unemployment and the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. \n\nThroughout the game, the author grapples with various economic developments, such as shifts in inflation and unemployment, as well as the challenge of making decisions based on the ever-changing economic data. They also experience the limits of monetary policy, as the game demonstrates the difficulty of managing an economy strictly through adjusting short-term interest rates.\n\nIn the end, the author draws three conclusions from their virtual experience as the Fed Chair: \n1. Modeling the economy is highly challenging due to the numerous unpredictable variables in the real world, and the limitations of basing decisions on economic textbook theories.\n2. Central banks cannot and should not be solely responsible for managing an economy; fiscal policy also plays a crucial role in supporting growth and stability.\n3. The role of central bankers is more difficult than most people imagine, and the author expresses sympathy for those who take on the responsibility of guiding the global economy.\n\nOverall, the article offers insights into the complex nature of economic management through monetary policy and highlights the importance of balancing fiscal and monetary tools to maintain a stable, thriving economy."}

Reputed to be a grand master of kung fu, he enters a tavern where he is immediately attacked by the local ruffians. However, they are no match for his skill and even the legendary kung fu masters, the Furious Five, bow down to the panda's skill, requesting to hang out with him and fight alongside him as......Po the giant panda (Jack Black) wakes up from his dream in his room. His goose father, Mr. Ping (James Hong) calls to him from the noodle restaurant below to help serve tables. Po admires his Furious Five action figures before going downstairs. An extreme fan of Kung Fu, Po dreams of one day becoming a master worthy of fighting alongside the Five but his girth and clumsiness makes this dream simply a dream and his kung fu talents reside only within his knowledge of moves and artifacts. He is hesitant to express his desires to his dad who is more interested in running his restaurant and advertising his famous 'secret ingredient soup'.Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a red panda who resides at the Jade Palace temple, practices kung fu in the courtyard with his students, the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen), before he is summoned to see tortoise Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). Fearing something is wrong, Shifu rushes to find him meditating in the grand hall. Oogway doesn't deny bad news but calmly tells Shifu he's predicted that the snow leopard warrior Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will escape prison and return to the Valley of Peace to wreak destruction once again. Intent on never letting this happen, Shifu sends his goose messenger, Zeng (Dan Fogler), to fly to Chor-Gom Prison to ensure that security is increased. Oogway then proclaims that it is time to choose the Dragon Warrior; a master of great skill who will be granted the secrets of the universe by reading the Dragon Scroll, kept delicately out of reach on the temple ceiling. Assuming that one of the Furious Five will be chosen, Shifu prepares a competition to determine which one will qualify.Flyers for the competition are spread throughout town and the villagers flock to the temple. Excited to have the opportunity to see his idols in person, Po follows with his noodle cart in tow but struggles on the long staircase to the temple. He is the last to arrive at the gates and finds that they've shut him out. In a desperate bid to see the competition before it's over, Po fashions fireworks to his cart and blasts himself high into the air, only to come crashing down in the arena just as Oogway is preparing to choose out of the Five. Po opens his eyes to see Oogway's finger pointed right at him and is shocked, along with everyone else, when he is proclaimed to be the Dragon Warrior. Oogway's decision is final, despite Shifu's protests, and Po is carried (unsuccessfully) into the temple leaving Tigress greatly disappointed since it seemed Oogway would have chosen her if Po hadn't arrived.Inside the temple, Po examines, with awe, the many weaponry and valuable artifacts before Shifu approaches him and berates him for his obvious lack of skill. He deflates Po's excitement by grabbing his finger in what Po recognizes as the Wuxi Finger Hold, reputed to be extremely powerful. Shifu promises that Po will regret ever being chosen before taking him to the Fives training room where Po is promptly put to the test. Nervous, but excited to try some kung fu moves, Po accepts the challenge but is hurtled, flung, and beaten down to a now-existing Level 0.On the way to the dormitories, Po overhears the Five poke fun at his incompetence. He has an awkward conversation with Crane, opening up to his own doubts of being the Dragon Warrior.

After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game.

The move by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education is the latest blow for the beleaguered university, which has seen its reputation clobbered and its football program hobbled after investigators found school leaders did too little to stop the abuse. Were the commission to pull Penn State's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs, guaranteed student loans, federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid, commission spokesman Richard Pockrass said in July. Paterno family wants to appeal Penn State sanctions. Penn State will resolve the commission's concerns, promised Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Blannie Bowen. \"This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,\" Bowen said in a statement posted Monday to the school's website. \"Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation.\" The commission voted August 6 to place the school on warning status. Two days later, it notified Penn State officials that the school's accreditation was \"in jeopardy\" based on information contained in former FBI Director Louis Freeh's report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky and a National Collegiate Athletic Association action against the school. Freeh found that Penn State's leadership showed \"total and consistent disregard\" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky, the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in June on 45 counts involving child sex abuse. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Among other things, authorities say school officials failed to properly address a report that Sandusky had been seen in a football complex shower, apparently engaged in sexual contact with a young boy. Timeline of the Penn State scandal. Last month, the NCAA fined Penn State $60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. The commission also said it had insufficient evidence that Penn State officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided \"accurate, fair and complete information\" about what was happening at the school, according to the letter. The commission asked Penn State to report by September 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements, as well as information about the school's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal. A team assembled by the commission will visit Penn State after the September report to evaluate the school's performance, the commission said. Bowen said the commission \"wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements\" and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation. \"It is critical to emphasize that Middle States does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance,\" Bowen said in the statement. \"This certainly is true for Penn State. We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission.\" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the warning seemed to be a bit of \"piling on\" in light of the sanctions already in place against Penn State. But it may be another factor to further motivate the university to comprehensively deal with the scandal, he said on CNN's \"Starting Point.\" \"It all creates pressure on Penn State to make sure it has policies in place to make sure nothing like this ever happens again,\" Toobin said.

Let's break down the two solutions and evaluate their effectiveness, practicality, and long-term benefits.\n\n1. Using an air freshener spray:\nAir freshener sprays are a popular and easily accessible method for making a room smell nice quickly. Let's consider the advantages and disadvantages of using an air freshener spray:\n\nAdvantages:\n- Provides an immediate effect, which is ideal in situations when you need to improve the room's scent quickly\n- Wide variety of scents available\n- Easy to use and portable – can be taken with you and used as needed\n- Affordable and can be found in most supermarkets or convenience stores\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Temporary solution; the fragrance fades away within a few hours\n- Potentially harmful chemicals found in some air fresheners might trigger allergies or respiratory issues in sensitive individuals or those with pre-existing health conditions\n- Overuse of air fresheners may result in an overpowering scent or a mix of unpleasant smells\n- Environmental concerns; aerosol sprays have been linked to contributing to air pollution and climate change\n\n2. Placing plants in the room:\nIntroducing plants in the room is a more natural and aesthetically pleasing approach to making a room smell nice. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of placing plants in a room:\n\nAdvantages:\n- More natural, environmentally friendly approach to improving the air quality\n- Some plants can purify the air and remove harmful chemicals\n- Provides a visually appealing and calming environment\n- Longer lasting option; plants can provide a pleasant scent continuously as long as they are well-maintained\n- May have a positive impact on mood and mental well-being\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires ongoing maintenance, such as watering and proper positioning of the plant based on its light requirements\n- Allergens, such as pollen, might be a concern for those susceptible to allergies\n- Limited choice of fragrances compared to air fresheners\n- May take longer to create a significant change in room's scent compared to air fresheners\n- Some plants can be toxic to pets or children if ingested\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between using an air freshener spray and placing plants in the room largely depends on your individual preferences and circumstances. If you require a quick and easy but temporary solution, air freshener sprays might be more suitable. However, if you prefer a more natural and environmentally friendly option that provides long-term benefits, placing plants in the room would be a better choice. In either case, exploring a combination of both methods, or periodic ventilation of the room to maintain fresh air circulation, can further enhance the effectiveness of the chosen solution."}

This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from Sonny & Cher's management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with Elektra Records and Warner Bros. Records, and arranged for the band to start recording at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood.  The first Buffalo Springfield single, \"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own mono mix was superior to the stereo mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's eponymous album was released by the Atlantic subsidiary Atco in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.  In November 1966, Stills composed \"For What It's Worth\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called Pandora's Box on Sunset Strip. The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station KHJ soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" with \"For What It's Worth\" and re-releasing the album. \"For What It's Worth\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.,\n\nEntity:", "response": "Buffalo Springfield"}

It is typically unrelated to the current topic of conversation and serves as an interesting tidbit to share with others. With countless topics and subjects to explore, random facts can be drawn from various fields like science, history, nature, and more. \n\nFor instance, did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! This remarkable characteristic of honey is due to its unique composition and chemical properties.\n\nHoney is a natural sweetener that bees create by collecting nectar from flowers. Once they return to their hive, they regurgitate the nectar and pass it on to other bees, who then store it in honeycomb cells. The bees proceed to fan the nectar with their wings, evaporating much of the water content and transforming it into a thick, sticky substance known as honey.\n\nThe low water content of honey plays a key role in its longevity. It creates an environment that is inhospitable for the growth of microorganisms, as they are unable to survive in such highly concentrated sugar solutions. Additionally, honey has a naturally acidic pH, which further inhibits the growth of bacteria and other pathogens.\n\nAnother factor contributing to honey's eternal shelf-life is the presence of an enzyme called glucose oxidase. Bees introduce this enzyme to honey when collecting and regurgitating the flower nectar. In the presence of oxygen, glucose oxidase breaks down glucose (a sugar in honey) into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, a well-known antimicrobial agent, helps to kill off any bacteria or other microorganisms that might be present.\n\nSo, if you ever find yourself enjoying a spoonful of honey, remember this fascinating random fact: you are consuming a natural food product that has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years and will continue to last indefinitely as long as it remains sealed from moisture and other contaminants."}

Think like you are answering to a five year old.", "question": "Write a title for this article:\n\nIn January 2009, SEC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Brenda Murray found that securities industry lawyer Steven Altman had engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct while representing a prospective witness for the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) in a SEC administrative proceeding. In the Matter of Steven Altman, Esq (Initial Decision Release No. 367, Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-12944, January 14, 2009). The ALJ’s Initial Decision sought to deny Altman the privilege of appearing before the SEC for a period of nine months.\n\nAccording to the ALJ’s Initial Decision, in January 2009, Altman was a forty-six year old graduate of Boston University and New York Law School, a member of the New York State Bar, and had been practicing law since 1987. Altman maintained an office in Manhattan where he employed one salaried attorney, who handled the paperwork, while Altman spent his time litigating commercial disputes in courts and before the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Altman did not have an extensive practice before the SEC.\n\nAltman was married in 1987 and divorced in 1999. He testified that he provided financial support for three children, and his fiancée and her child with whom he lived. Altman maintained that in January and February 2004, he was working ten to fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, drinking very heavily, and in a contentious relationship with his ex-wife who has custody of his seven year old twins with whom he has a close relationship. On March 30, 2008, Altman admitted himself to a hospital where he was diagnosed with alcohol and cocaine abuse. He left a twenty-eight day program on April 7, 2008, after eight days and began participating in an out-patient program at a different facility. On May 6, 2008, Altman testified that, since April 8, 2008, he had participated in the out-patient program four days a week and has attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous daily.\n\nThe Initial Decision found that Altman offered to have a client evade the Division’s service of a subpoena and/or testify falsely in exchange for a financial package from two respondents in the proceeding. The ALJ further found that Altman did so with scienter, and, as a result of his conduct, he violated Disciplinary Rules (“DR”) 1-102(A)(4), 102(A)(5), and 102(A)(7) of the New York State Bar Association Lawyer’s Code of Professional Responsibility. Pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice and Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the ALJ suspended Altman from appearing or practicing before the SEC for nine months.\n\nNine Months Not Enough Say OGC\n\nThe SEC’s Office of the General Counsel (“OGC”) appealed the nine-month suspension imposed on Altman in the Initial Decision, and sought an order permanently denying him the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission.\n\nAccording to the SEC, Altman had known Bonnie Rosen since he was in high school and she worked at a local insurance agency. From November 1999 to October 2003, Rosen worked as an administrative assistant with a salary of $60,000 at Nextgen Inc. (“Nextgen”), a company that was owned by Jay Adoni and shared office space with Harrison Securities, Inc. (“Harrison”), a broker-dealer. Nextgen paid Rosen’s salary, but she spent half of her time working for Harrison and its chief executive officer, Frederick C. Blumer, who was Adoni’s close business associate.\n\nSometime in 2003, Rosen called Altman and told him that she had been forced out of her job at Nextgen. Rosen asked Altman for his help in obtaining severance pay from Nextgen and removing her name from two car leases she co-signed for Blumer, who used the cars and paid the leases. Altman testified that he agreed to assist Rosen as a “favor.” Altman twice contacted Adoni and requested that he pay Rosen severance and remove her name from the car leases. On both occasions, Adoni refused the requests.\n\nIn 2003, the Division instituted administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Harrison, Blumer, and Nebrissa Song, alleging violations of the Exchange Act’s books and records, net capital, and financial reporting provisions (hereinafter the “Harrison Proceeding”). Respondents raised as a defense to the books and records charge that they were unable to maintain the firm’s general ledger for certain periods because a computer virus corrupted their files. A hearing in the Harrison Proceeding was held on January 20 through January 26, 2004 and March 8 through 10, 2004.\n\nDivision Wants to Talk to Rosen\n\nOn January 26, 2004, Division staff learned from NASD staff that Rosen had called NASD and claimed to have information adverse to Harrison’s and Blumer’s computer virus defense. Division staff hoped, but were not sure, that Rosen would be able to testify that there was no computer virus that compromised Harrison’s files. Division staff also thought that Rosen might be able to testify about Blumer’s accounting practices. Division staff concluded that Rosen might be a good rebuttal witness.\n\nDivision staff called Rosen on January 28, 2004 and told her that they learned she might have useful information for the Harrison Proceeding. They asked Rosen if she would be willing to meet or speak with them. Rosen expressed some anxiety about testifying. She mentioned to Division staff that she co-signed two car leases for Blumer, and she was concerned that if Blumer was ordered to pay a civil penalty in the Harrison Proceeding, it might increase the likelihood that he would default on the leases and she would have to pay the remaining balance on the leases. Division staff testified that the car leases were not relevant to their case and were not a subject of interest to them, except insofar as the leases might prevent Rosen from testifying in the Harrison Proceeding. Rosen identified Altman as her attorney and referred Division staff to him.\n\nAltman Speaks to Division As Rosen’s Lawyer\n\nOn or about January 28, 2004, Division staff spoke with Altman, who identified himself as Rosen’s legal representative. During the conversation, Division staff described the nature of the Harrison Proceeding, indicated that it was ongoing, and expressed their interest in possibly using Rosen’s testimony as part of their case. Division staff asked Altman if they could interview Rosen. Division staff testified that Altman was “noncommital” about whether Rosen would agree to an interview and said that he would get back to them. Altman asked Division staff who was representing Harrison and Blumer, and they gave him Irving Einhorn’s name.\n\nThe SEC concluded that Altman first called Einhorn on or about January 28, 2004. In this conversation, Altman told Einhorn that he represented Rosen and that the Division was interested in possibly using her as a witness in the Harrison Proceeding. Altman also told Einhorn that Rosen had left Nextgen under unfavorable circumstances with little or no severance pay; she had worked for Harrison and Blumer; and she was hostile towards them. Altman gave Einhorn an abbreviated version of his discussions with Adoni and said he thought this would be an opportune time to reinvigorate Rosen’s requests for severance pay and removal of her name from the car leases. In his hearing testimony and briefs on appeal, Altman admitted that the Division’s interest in Rosen as a witness gave him some leverage to renew her requests.\n\nEinhorn testified that he decided to tape record their subsequent conversations because he believed Altman was engaging in an “extortion attempt” and wanted to protect himself and his clients in the event Rosen testified in the Harrison Proceeding “without being paid off.” Einhorn did not tell Altman that he was taping their conversations, and Altman was unaware that he was being taped. In a taped telephone conversation on February 2, 2004, the following discussion ensued:\n\nMR. ALTMAN: I am not going to pull punches with you. They [Division staff] are aware[,] if asked, [Rosen] will testify that there was no virus in the computer,10 and I suspect once they start peeling it away, some other very, very unhelpful stuff with respect to the books and records of the firm –\n\nMR. ALTMAN: As I understand it, [b]ased on her personal knowledge, . . . it was a small suite of executive offices that they all sat in.\n\nMR. ALTMAN: And that this was not just a professional relationship, it was personal, not, not in any –\n\nMR. EINHORN: Not a sexual or intimate way.\n\nMR. ALTMAN: Not an intimate way, but a personal basis. And, listen, when you have a $60,000 a year secretary co-signing for cars of a president of a firm, it . . . raises eyebrows initially.11 Frankly, probably all this would have gone away if at least something would have happened,12 but, you know, if that’s Fred’s [Blumer] view, that is — you know, it shouldn’t have gone forward.\n\nMR. EINHORN: No, no, no, I am here, Steven, trying to figure out what’s happening here. So, she hasn’t given that testimony?\n\nMR. ALTMAN: That’s correct. She is not a registered rep[resentative] so she is not at risk of losing her license if she doesn’t appear any place.\n\nMR. EINHORN: Well, suppose she gets a subpoena to appear at the hearing?\n\nMR. ALTMAN: Well, you know[,] if she gets served, then, you know, she is going to be [like] any other human being. I, of course, can’t advise her to evade the [subpoena] process, but . . . [m]emory fades and the like.13 And you know[,] I don’t know.\n\nMR. EINHORN: So, what you are saying is[,] if they reach some agreement, she would be more favorably inclined?\n\nMR. ALTMAN: That would be my guess as to what her recollection would be, you know.14 I don’t have the personal knowledge, and I haven’t done a full debriefing of her. I know Fred, I met him, as he may have told you.\n\nMR. EINHORN: Yeah, no, [Fred] told me he likes you.\n\nMR. ALTMAN: I like him. He is a nice guy. This is all silly. I hate to see this happen. Really, it would be terrible.\n\nMR. ALTMAN: If somebody just does the right thing,15 and\n\nMR. EINHORN: But you think they learned about this from others and were pointed to her. They have other people lined up that are\n\nMR.ALTMAN: No, no. I don’t think that is the case.\n\nMR. EINHORN: You don’t think they have other people coming to testify?\n\nMR. ALTMAN: No, no, not with respect to what I talked to you about.\n\nMR. ALTMAN: I think if you cut it off with her, then it is closed. 16 That will be[,] you know[,] killing themselves.\n\nYou can read the additional taped conversations at http://sec.gov/litigation/opinions/2010/34-63306.pdf\n\nAfter the hearing in the Harrison Proceeding, Einhorn withdrew as counsel for Harrison and Blumer and disclosed the tapes to law enforcement authorities. In September 2004, the ALJ in the Harrison Proceeding issued an initial decision finding that Harrison and Blumer had violated the federal securities laws, but that Rosen had been “thoroughly impeached” on cross-examination and was not a reliable witness.\n\nThe SEC’s Opinon on Appeal\n\nFollowing appeal, the SEC independently reviewed the case and found that Altman had engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct while representing a prospective witness in an SEC administrative proceeding, in violation of state bar disciplinary rules. In a rare move, the SEC permanently denied Altman the privilege of appearing or practicing before the SEC. In the Matter of Steven Altman, Esq, (Securities Exchange Act Of 1934 Rel. No. 63306 / Admin. Proc. File No. 3-12944, November 10, 2010).\n\nOn December 9, 2010, the Courthouse News Service (CNS) published an article titled: Attorney Declares War on SEC. The CNS story states that\n\nAttorney Steven Altman sued the SEC in Federal Court, claiming the agency “has wrongfully sought to ‘federalize’ the subject of attorney ethics discipline” – a function of state judiciaries – by its Nov. 10 order permanently barring him from “appearing or practicing (law) before the Commission.”\n\nAccording to CNS, Altman claims that “there is absolutely no statutory authority granting the Commission to unilaterally apply part or even all of the New York State Disciplinary Rules to anyone.” Moreover, the lawyer does not view his action as an appeal of the SEC’s Opinion and Order but rather a “facial attack on the Commission’s jurisdiction to bring the [underlying] proceeding.”\n\nCNS says that Altman argues that he has been “vilified by the Commission and in effect been accused of being and found to be unfit to practice law at all, a conclusion which is not in any way supported by and contrary to his record.” Altman alleges that the SEC’s action was an ”unconstitutional usurpation of the New York State Disciplinary Rules,” and he concludes that such improper action violated his right to equal protection, due process and privacy. Altman seeks to enjoin the SEC’s Order against him.\n\nAltman’s Complaint pointedly dismisses the nature of his legal action against the SEC as an “appeal,” but characterizes it as seeking declaratory, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief against the SEC; and further seeking an Order of Mandamus directing the vacatur and stay of proceedings, decisions, and orders.\n\nFurther, Altman’s Complaint asserts that the SEC’s proceedings, decisions, and orders against him constituted the first instance in which the SEC has\n\ndisciplined a lawyer solely for allegations of New York State’s disciplinary rules without a prior hearing, determination or even charges brought against that lawyer by or under the New York State disciplinary procedures.\n\nIn explaining the extent of damage he has sustained as a result of the SEC’s action, Altman’s Complaint states that:\n\nPlaintiff’s reputation as a lawyer is his stock and trade. That reputation has been intentionally and permanently marred by the Commission’s unconstitutional actions against him.\n\nClick here to read full-text copies of Altman’s Complaint and Memoradum of Law.

Article: At Denver there was an crowd of passengers into the coaches  on the eastbound B. & M. express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank face expression and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed  together. As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only available seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her face and a tender pink tingeing(,) her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard. \"Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?\" The younger man aroused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand. \"It's Miss Fairchild,\" he said, with a smile. \"I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; \"it's otherwise engaged just at present.\" He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining \"bracelet\" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague(,), relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's face expression with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes. \"You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with(,) the officer here.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime?  Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.\nAnswer:", "response": "Given the information provided, it is difficult to definitively determine which police department (P.D.) implemented a more efficient approach to fighting crime. Both Greenville and Grayville P.D. took different approaches, and each approach has its own advantages and drawbacks.\n\nGreenville P.D. did not invest in advanced technology such as DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. This may have allowed them to allocate more resources towards traditional law enforcement methods, like increased patrolling and forming strong community ties. Not using advanced technological resources can lead to cost savings which can be used in other areas of crime-fighting. Moreover, as the hint suggests, law enforcement officers may be unfamiliar with information technology, so their skills and interest in pursuing attackers may be limited. Thus, Greenville P.D.'s approach might be more suitable given their personnel's expertise and limited resources.\n\nOn the other hand, Grayville P.D. took extensive measures to invest in advanced technologies such as DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology. While these technologies can be costly and may take away valuable resources from other forms of law enforcement, they offer significant benefits in solving complex cases and enabling quicker identification and apprehension of criminals. By investing in advanced technology, law enforcement can exploit new and innovative methods for apprehending criminals and solving a wide range of crimes, from property theft to more serious offenses such as murder or sexual assault.\n\nIt is important to consider that the efficiency of a crime-fighting approach is not solely determined by the use of technology. Factors such as community engagement, cooperation with international law enforcement agencies, and the expertise and training of police officers may also contribute to a police department's effectiveness in addressing crime.\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to determine which P.D. took a more efficient approach in fighting crime, as both Greenville and Grayville's approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Both departments face challenges, such as budgetary constraints and a rapidly changing technological landscape, which may impact the overall effectiveness of their strategies. Ultimately, the most efficient approach may involve finding a balance between leveraging advanced technology in crime-fighting while also maintaining the focus on traditional law enforcement methods and tactics."}

Step by step answer:", "response": "Based on the given premise and hypothesis, we will analyze if the hypothesis can be entailed by the premise. Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Premise: \"Soccer players in blue before a game.\"\nThis premise provides us with the information that there are soccer players who are wearing blue uniforms, and this happens before a game. This implies that the soccer players are already present on the field prior to the commencement of a match.\n\n2. Hypothesis: \"The players are waiting for the beginning of the game.\"\nThe hypothesis states that the players are waiting for the game to start. This is a reasonable assumption since the players are present on the field before the game begins.\n\n3. Assessing the entailment between the premise and the hypothesis:\nTo determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to evaluate if the premise provides enough information for us to infer that the players are waiting for the beginning of the game.\n\n4. Conclusion:\nWhile the premise suggests that soccer players are present in their blue uniforms before the game, it does not explicitly mention whether they are waiting for the game to start or engaging in some other pre-game activities such as warm-ups or team discussions.\n\nThe hypothesis is a plausible interpretation of the given premise, but it may not be completely entailed by the premise.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \"You know what it is? You get complacent,\" he said. \"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\" Trump told the audience. \"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats? - Because he wanted to win, with no other reason - Because Democrats were insulting Trump - not enough information - Because opinion polls said they had an edge\nThe answer to this question is:", "response": "Because opinion polls said they had an edge"}

If you want to meet people and make friends, you must be willing to take some action. You must first go where there are people. You won't make friends staying home alone. Joining a club or a group, talking with those who like the same things as you do is much easier. Or join someone in some activity. Many people are nervous when talking to new people. After all meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about unknown. Most of our fears about dealing with new people comes from doubts about ourselves. We imagine other people are judging us, finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same way. Try to accept yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease. You'll both feel more comfortable. Try to act self-confident even if you don't feel that way. When you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall and straight, look directly at other people and smile. If you see someone you'd like to speak to, say something. Don't wait for the other person to start a conversation. Just meeting someone new does not mean that you will make friends with that person--friendship is based on mutual liking and \"give and take\". It takes time and effort to develop.

Having been with countless women across the city, Chad had perfected his understanding of their desires, and he loved to share his wisdom with his friends. \n\nAs the night wore on, the conversation veered towards Chad's favorite topic: what women wanted. The gathering took place at Mich's apartment, one of those cool, modern lofts with floor-to-ceiling windows and minimalist furniture. The soft glow of the city lights outside provided the perfect ambiance as everyone sipped their beverages, alternately laughing and nodding in agreement with Chad's advice.\n\nMitch, though initially amused, began to grow increasingly curious about Chad's statement. Surely, there had to be more to it than just being smooth. Chad was an attractive man, but it wasn't just his looks that had women flocking to him. There had to be something else.\n\nAs if reading Mitch's thoughts, Chad continued, \"I'm telling y'all, it goes beyond just shaving. It's about being confident, taking care of yourself, and making women feel special. Trust me, they will love you for it.\"\n\nLena, a sharp-witted friend, chimed in, \"So, Chad, are you telling me you just shave your legs, wink at a girl, and she's all over you? I'm pretty sure there's more to it than that.\"\n\nChad smirked at Lena's remark, taking a sip of his beer before replying, \"Well, I guess I'm just toying with you folks. Truth is, I treat every woman I meet with the utmost respect. You know, listen to them, show genuine interest in their lives, and make them feel valued. Shaving is just a small part of the whole picture.\"\n\nThe room fell silent as everyone pondered Chad's insight. Of course, Chad was right. The smooth exterior might have been attractive, but it was the kindness and caring that truly won women over. \n\nMitch, mulling over the conversation, couldn't help but admit to himself that he could learn a lot from Chad's approach. Noticing that his wineglass was empty, Mitch began to refill it, but Chad reached out and clinked his beer can against his friend's glass.\n\n\"Here's to truly understanding the ladies,\" Chad toasted, a wry smile playing on his lips. \"And to us, growing, learning, and becoming better men.\"\n\nEveryone raised their glasses in agreement, knowing they had all gleaned wisdom from Chad's words that night. Despite his man-whore reputation, Chad had managed to capture something essential about relationships: the importance of compassion, understanding, and a genuine connection, all wrapped up in a silky-smooth package."}

Deep spirituality: Some people, particularly within the Catholic tradition, view stigmata as a sign of deep spirituality, as it is believed to be the spontaneous appearance of wounds on the body that resemble those of Jesus Christ during his crucifixion.\n\n2. Advanced psychosis: From a psychiatric perspective, stigmata could potentially be interpreted as manifestations of advanced psychosis, as the individual might be experiencing vivid hallucinations or delusions related to religious themes.\n\n3. Self-harm: In some cases, it's possible that individuals might inflict the wounds upon themselves, either consciously or unconsciously, as a form of self-harm or attention-seeking behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, stigmata may be seen as a sign of deep spirituality, advanced psychosis, or self-harm, depending on the perspective and circumstances surrounding each particular case.\n\nSecond question: What is it like to have deep psychosis?\n\nDeep psychosis generally refers to a severe mental disorder in which a person loses touch with reality, experiencing delusions, hallucinations, or disordered thinking. The experience of deep psychosis can be quite distressing, as the individual may perceive things that aren't real or believe things that are false or irrational. Each person's experience might differ depending on the specific symptoms and their intensity.\n\nAre these two questions asking the same thing?\n\nBased on the contents of both questions, I would select answer 1). No. They are not asking the same thing. While the first question explores the meaning and interpretations of stigmata, the second question focuses on understanding the experience of deep psychosis. Although there is a connection between the two questions in the context of the first question's discussion of psychosis as a potential cause of stigmata, they address distinct concepts and prompt different responses."}

Morning: This word indicates the particular time of day that the setting or scene is taking place. The morning is typically associated with the beginning of the day, sunrise, and the transition from darkness to light.\n\n2. Sky: Sky is one of the primary elements of the sentence that gives us information about the context and location. It suggests that the scene described involves an open view of the atmosphere, with possible focus on the colors, clouds, and weather conditions at that time.\n\n3. Mountains: This keyword provides information about the landscape and geographic features of the scene. Mountains evoke images of high terrain, elevated peaks, and a wide range of flora and fauna. The keyword \"mountains\" instantly transports the reader to an expansive, rugged environment.\n\n4. Near: The word \"near\" indicates proximity, suggesting that the scene takes place close to another important element - in this case, a lake. This word is crucial for understanding the relationship between the two landscapes (mountains and lake) and their position relative to each other.\n\n5. Lake: This keyword introduces a significant water body present in the scene. A lake is usually associated with tranquility, reflection, and a variety of aquatic life. \"Lake\" suggests that the body of water is a key aspect of the landscape, and it may also imply that it plays a role in the activities, flora, and fauna of the area.\n\nIn summary, the keywords \"morning,\" \"sky,\" \"mountains,\" \"near,\" and \"lake\" help paint a picture of the scene in the sentence, describing the time of day, landscape, and geographic features involved."}

Heimskringla, Fagrskinna and Morkinskinna all describe the period up to the year 1177, although the parts of Morkinskinna that are preserved only extend to 1157. These three sagas were written c. 1220-1230, and in using them as historical sources, it has to be remembered that they were thus written a fair amount of time after the events they describe. However, they are likely to have been based on earlier works, in particular the saga Hryggjarstykki, written c. 1150, which is lost to us, but was available to the authors of the three aforementioned sagas. Ágrip af Noregs konunga sögum also describes the civil war era, but has only been preserved up to the events of c. 1136. The period 1177 to 1240  is treated in detail in contemporaneous sagas: Sverris saga  the Bagler sagas  and Håkon Håkonsson's saga . These sagas were written very shortly after the events they describe. However, as they don't overlap, we are given only one version of events , and this version tends to be from the viewpoint of the main character of the saga. From the later part of the period, fragments of documentation start to appear. The oldest Norwegian royal letter which is preserved was made out by Philippus the bagler king. Also, a couple of runic inscriptions written by central figures survive: A rune letter, probably written by King Sverre's son, Sigurd Lavard c. 1200 has been found during excavations in Bergen, and an inscription by Magnus Erlingsson's brother, Sigurd Erlingsson Jarlsson, dated 18 June 1194, has been preserved from a portal of the now dismantled Vinje stave church.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.", "question": "Background: William II (Old Norman: Williame; c. 1056 - 2 August 1100), the third son of William the Conqueror, was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for 'the Red'), perhaps because of his red-faced appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.\nContext: William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book, a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma, or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the Curia Regis, the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated.  In external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm III's brother Donald seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by Edgar AEtheling. Edgar recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.  William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.  In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks--a sum equalling about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.  As regent for his brother Robert in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade Aquitaine at the time of his death.\nQuestion: how long did it last for. Whats the answer?", "response": "The question seems to be asking about the duration of a particular event or period in William II's life, but it is not specific as to which event or period it is referring to. Here are a few durations related to events mentioned in the context:\n\n1. Reign as King of England: William II, also known as William Rufus, reigned as King of England from 1087 until his death in 1100, which is approximately 13 years.\n\n2. Robert Curthose's participation in the First Crusade: William's brother, Robert Curthose, joined the First Crusade in 1096. He did not return to Normandy until September 1100, which means his participation in the Crusade lasted around 4 years.\n\n3. William's regency in Normandy: As a regent for his brother in Normandy, William campaigned in France between 1097 and 1099, a period of about 2 years.\n\nIf you could provide more specific details about the event or period you are referring to, I would be glad to give you a more accurate answer regarding its duration."}

The following factors contribute to the rationale behind Quora's decision to enforce these restrictions:\n\n1. Clarity: Concise questions tend to be clearer and easier to understand. By imposing a word limit, Quora encourages users to focus on the essential components of their queries, ensuring that the questions posed are easy to read and comprehend. In turn, this facilitates more accurate responses from individuals who possess relevant knowledge or expertise in the subject matter.\n\n2. User Experience: Restricting the length of questions and descriptions on Quora significantly improves the platform's user experience. By presenting brief, succinct questions, users can quickly scan and identify the topics that interest them or those to which they can contribute valuable insights. This increases user engagement, participation, and satisfaction on the platform.\n\n3. Maintain Focused Conversations: Another critical aspect of implementing a word limit on Quora is the ability to maintain focused conversations around specific topics. By encouraging users to keep their questions concise and to the point, the platform minimizes the likelihood of numerous branching or unrelated discussions, which can often lead to confusion and dilute the value of the information exchange. As a result, Quora can better fulfill its role as an efficient knowledge-sharing platform.\n\n4. Demands on Attention: In today's fast-paced and information-saturated world, people often have limited attention spans. Long and verbose questions have the potential to lose a reader's interest, leading them to bypass the question or miss essential details. By setting a word limit on questions and descriptions, Quora ensures that its platform remains engaging and accessible to a diverse user base.\n\n5. Quality Control: A word limit encourages users to prioritize the quality of their questions over quantity. It discourages the use of excessive information or irrelevant details that could potentially derail a discussion or dilute the question's primary focus. This emphasis on quality helps ensure that Quora remains an effective platform for knowledge exchange.\n\nIn summary, the word limit for questions and question descriptions on Quora contributes significantly to the platform's functionality and user experience. Through these restrictions, Quora promotes concise, clear, and relevant questions that foster targeted and meaningful conversations among members of its community."}

Today, we are going to talk about something called a \"census.\" A census is when people collect information about everyone living in a country. One of the things they ask is what language everyone speaks. Sometimes, people don't speak English even if they live in a country where most people do.\n\nNow, let's try to find out what percent of people in our imaginary country don't speak English. For this, we'll use pretend numbers, okay?\n\nImagine that there are 1,000 people living in this country. After the census, we learn that 800 of them speak English. But that means there are still 200 people who don't speak English. \n\nTo find the percent of people who don't speak English, we're going to play with numbers. Here's what we do: \n\nStep 1: We take the number of people who don't speak English (200) and divide it by the total number of people (1,000). Like this: \n\n200 ÷ 1,000 = 0.2 \n\nStep 2: To change 0.2 into a percent, we simply multiply it by 100. Like this:\n\n0.2 x 100 = 20\n\nThat's it! We found out that 20% of the people in our imaginary country don't speak English. Isn't it interesting to learn about different languages and cultures? Just remember that every country and every census is different. The real numbers might be very different from our pretend ones.\n\nNow you know how to find what percentage of people don't speak a particular language using a census!

Flying to Twinleaf Town is the quickest way to get to the lake. You'll find the Verity Cavern entrance in the middle of the lake. You'll see Mesprit in the center of the room. It will look like the battle is about to start, and then Mesprit will run away before it begins. Professor Rowan will inform you that Mesprit is now roaming throughout Sinnoh, and that you can track it on the map. Roaming Pokémon like Mesprit will change locations every time you move between locations. This can make tracking them down difficult, but there's a trick you can use to speed it up. Walking between these two locations is the most effective way to encounter a roaming Pokémon due to the close proximity of tall grass on each side and the low level wild Pokemon. Each time you walk from one location to the other, Mesprit will move to a new location in Sinnoh. You can see its current location flashing on your Marking Map in the lower screen. Mesprit's movements are random, so you may have to go back and forth many times until you're both in the same spot. Once you've changed locations and Mesprit is in the same location you are, use a Repel so that you don't encounter any other Pokemon. If you encounter another Pokémon or start a battle with a trainer, Mesprit will move and you'll have to start over. Save before attempting to encounter Mesprit so you can quickly try again if you accidentally mess up. Since you're using a Repel, you won't encounter any Pokémon lower than your first Pokemon's level. This will prevent you from encountering any of the wild Pokémon in these two areas. If your first Pokémon is over level 50, the Repel will prevent you from encountering Mesprit.\n\nSummary:", "response": "After defeating Team Galactic and preparing your party, head to Lake Verity to encounter Mesprit, who becomes a roaming Pokémon through Sinnoh, making it challenging to catch; use the Marking Map to track its location, walk between areas with tall grass, utilize Repel to avoid other encounters, and save beforehand for a successful attempt."}

She then spots a White Rabbit in a waistcoat passing by, exclaiming that he is \"late for a very important date\". Alice gives chase, following him into a large, furnished rabbit hole. She falls down into a vertical passage, and sees the Rabbit disappear into a room and leave through a tiny door. She tries to follow him but is too big to fit through the door, whose talking knob advises her to alter her size by drinking from a bottle marked âDrink Meâ, which appears on a table. The contents cause her to shrink rapidly. Unfortunately, the door is locked and the key is on the table, out of reach. A box of cookies appears before Alice, and she tries one marked âEat Meâ, and grows so large that her head hits the ceiling. Upset, she weeps large tears which flood the room. She drinks the last of the contents in the bottle and shrinks again, easily floating through the door's keyhole and into Wonderland inside the bottle.

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto.

Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth. One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work. Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and \"good times\". The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.
